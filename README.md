# learning how to terraform with various AWS services

This repo is more of a sandbox of me trying out things to find ways that work nicely.

Currently has nice modules for lambdas that need dynamodb tables, routes to integrate them onto an API gateway.

Makefile and bundle script to bundle handlers with esbuild.
